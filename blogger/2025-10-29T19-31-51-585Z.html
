    Today's crypto market is a dynamic mix of regulatory shifts and technological convergence. Key developments include prediction market giant Polymarket's regulated US comeback and Truth Social's entry into the space, signaling mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, the synergy between crypto and AI intensifies, with Bitcoin miners like CleanSpark pivoting to power AI data centers and presales like Blazpay leveraging AI. Investors are closely watching for potential market bubbles and the upcoming Fed rate decision, which could significantly impact Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Institutional interest remains strong, highlighted by Securitize's $1.25 billion SPAC deal, reinforcing the ongoing integration of digital assets into traditional finance.
